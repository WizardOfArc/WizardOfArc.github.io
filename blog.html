                <p>It's been a while since I have written anything here. There has been a wee update.</p>
                <p>I have changed the 'dynamically' rendered pages from client run vanilla js to precompiling it locally using Rust code and Tera templating. Tera being a Jinja/Django like templating system written in rust. So now I update the templates or data files in my other Repo then run my builder and it updates the static pages on github pages.</p>
                <p>The silly things I do to get around paying for hosting.</p>
                <p>Shhh...</p>

                <p>The songwriting room is a safe and sacred space. No one has to know who sang what, or who played what, or even how badly things were sang or played. What matters is making the song.  Performanace and records are different animals than songwriting altogether. In the songwriting room the person who is normally the drummer can hop over to the keys and the singer can jump on drums - whatever it takes to get the song germinated.</p>
                <p>Later, folks can get back onto their "regular" instruments to hash out arrangements and practice for performance - you don't have to play things in the arrangement in which they are written.</p>
                <p>Also, as an added bonus - and if you want to change things up - you can switch who plays what if it feels good to everyone . It might be fun for the audience.</p>
                <p>But back to the main point. You can bare your soul in the songwriting room - no one outside that room needs to know who said or sang what or how.</p>

                <p>Athough we love them, the little black dots of "standard" notation can be a barrier to sharing information or tips about music composition. If you can read it already - you have a lot of information automatically bundled in, but knowing how to read standard notation shouldn't be a prerequisite to learning how to write sounds.  Especially since the most common instrument nowdays is the Midi piano roll.</p>
                <p>The midi piano roll is a grid system - x-axis is time divided into the subdivisions and the y-axis is the pitch space in semitones.  This is very intuitive and is closer to a moree scientific view of music.  It also can be a bridge between tab and standard notatation.</p>
                <p>Going forward, I'm going to try using these "music-grid" images to explain musical concepts and composition tips.</p>

                <p>So, due to some numbness in my left hand, which is likely from my guitars and basses adding strain to my neck and shoulders, I'm going to pivot to using the more "Ergonomic" Instruments like Drums, Keys, and Voice.</p>
                <p>This will have a period of frustration as I am not as fluid on keys and drums as I am on guitar or bass - but I gotta do what I gotta do.  Hopefully it will open up a different world of sounds for me.</p>

                <p>I've decided to get back into working with LilyPond</p>
                <p>LilyPond is a music engraving program that compiles text based files into notation and midi. It's heavily inspired by and built on LaTeX. It is very progammery but it has the power to have human readable code and work with version control</p>
                <p>I'm looking forward to getting better at using all my musical tools.</p>

                <p>Here's the hot take and TL;DR - they are the same thing.</p>
                <p>The bottom voice of your chord progression is your Cantus Firmus and the other notes of the chords are the "pre-installed" other voices already set as one to one counterpoint against The Cantus Firmus. Writing a melody to the chord progression is just adding a new line in florid counterpoint.</p>
                <p>Bottom line: Chord Theory is kind of a short-hand or hack for counterpoint.</p>
                <p>What are your thoughts?</p>

                <p>I am a bit of a Nerd but an artistically motivated one.</p>
                <p>I used to be horrible at mathematics until I figured out how it related to drawing and codes - I was obessed with secret codes. After I found that relationship between math and art - I was hooked - and I ended up getting my Bachelors in Mathematics.</p>
                <p>Same with programming - I get obsessed with writing programs if it can make my life easier in art and music - hence my programming to help with this blog.</p>

                <p>So here I am trying to add support for writing blog entries as simple text files. The idea here is that this will allow to also write in ways where I can correct my spelling and other errors before submitting. Have a function for adding a Post inline <em>and</em> via a file allows for greator flexibility.</p>
                <p>I may use this approach for creating Wizard Of Aarc's Grimoire. My collection of tips, reflections, and epiphanies for all things music and music related. Whether or not the blog becomes the Grimoire is another question altogether.</p>
                <p>How does this look?</p>
