Replace the sheet music pngs with svgs of music graphs
Music graphs being grids with the x axis being the pulse and meter - use different color lines for different metric stresses, and use the y axis as the "piano" roll
Each row is a pitch - use default white and gray rectangles
The have a different color rectangle for the notes themselves.
