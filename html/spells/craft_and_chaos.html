<h2>Embrace the Craft and The Chaos</h2>
  <p>
    It is vital that you leverage and enjoy the interplay and balance of the two opposing forces:
    <ul>
      <li>Learning as much about music theory and craft and "rules" as you can and learn how things "should" be done</li>
      <li>The randomness and chaos of: "I have no Idea what this is but damn! I love how it sounds!"</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Life is best when Chaos and Order can play together</p>

<hr>
<h2>Order of The Song</h2>
<p>The order in which a song is written has nothing to do with the order in which the sections of the song are performed.
</p>
<p>
You can write the song in the following order if you wanted:

<ol>
  <li>
 riff
  </li><li>
chorus
  </li><li>
verse
  </li><li>
bridge / middle
  </li><li>
intro / outro
  </li>
</ol>
Know one has to know except the songwriters.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Rember Contrast and Continuity </h2>
<p>
Keep something familiar to stitch the song together,
yet contrast the sections enough to give the listener a break from monotony.
<p></p>
Also, choruses are called chorus because that's when the group sings! (From Greek theatre)
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Remember The Greeks</h2>
<p>
The Chorus was the part of Greek Theatre where a group would sing the gist of what's going on.  Remember that when writing your choruses:<ul>
  <li>This is where we all want to sing together, make it so they we can.</li>
  <li>This is where the big idea, theme, and what you are trying to say with your song goes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<h2>A Song Is Not Its Arrangement</h2>
<p>
The bare minimum or essence of a song is:<br> <strong><em>basic structure,
    lyrics, and melody</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
A lead sheet is a nice example of an artifact of "pure song essence"
</p>
<p>
What instruments play what is arrangement - song can have many different arrangements.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Get To Singing Quickly </h2>
<p>
Don't get caught up in the instrumental options before the place for melody and vocals are made. So get to singing and words as soon as possible. They can even be made up gibberish words for the first draft.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Make Your Mistakes Quickly</h2>
<p>
Instead of taking forever to craft the impossibly perfect "only version" - quickly make drafts and share them with your co-writers - then if there is feedback to change - quickly iterate - if not - hey it's done!
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Great Songs Are Rewritten </h2>
<p>
So don't wait:  get that first draft together quickly and then iterate later- so feel free to throw in placeholders to make sure you get to your first draft quickly.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>When Arranging Be Aware of Density</h2>
<p>
Choruses should tend to be denser than verses
</p><p>
The whole song should gradually get denser, although there may be a section that is a bit sparser in order to make a final section sound HUGE!
</p>
<p>
A couple ways of making things less dense:
<ul>
  <li>Reduce the number of instruments </li>
  <li>Reduce how much each instrument plays</li>
  <li>Both of the above</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
One approach is to arrange "backwards" the most dense version (the last chorus) first and then thin parts out and lay them out in the reverse song order ( unless you want the most sparse to be the penultimate )
