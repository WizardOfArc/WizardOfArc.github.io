            <div class="description">This is essentiually breaking a longer note into shorter notes. This is really simple in a DAW's piano roll. But still not too hard with western traditional notation. There a few different ways depending on what your needs / desires are.</div>
            <div class="steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the long note into shorter repeated notes</li>
                    <li>Move the little notes up or down, leave some in place, and in some cases remove some to make rests or syncopations.</li>
                    <li>Some common patterns depending on what note follows this original note - but in all cases the first note of the diminution is the same pitch as the original note.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If next note is a step above and we are breaking the original note into 4 there are two common patterns:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>start note - upper neighbor - lower neighbor - and start note again</li>
                                    <li>start note - a note a third below - then go up the scale</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>If next note is a step below and we are breaking the original note into 4 there are two common patterns:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>start note - lower neighbor - upper neighbor - and start note again</li>
                                    <li>start note - a note a third above - then go down the scale</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>If next note is the same and we are breaking the original note into 4 there are two common patterns:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>start note - lower neighbor - the go up the scale</li>
                                    <li>start note - upper neighbor - then go down the scale</li>
