        <h1>AA (Asynchronous Arrangement)</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="description"><p>Ways of working on arranging a song when you can't be in the same place at the same time.
            This is for figuring out the arrangement - and a demo as a guide for rehearsal - not as a way of coming up with the official recording.</p>
            <p>
This presumes that a lead sheet (LS) has been created (which has lyrics, melody, and chord chart)
and that the arrangement is done to support live playing.</p></div>
          <h2>Two Methods</h2>
            <div class="steps">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h3>Round Robin (RR)</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
Starting with one person - they write, play, and record their part all the way through (doesn’t have to be the final version - can be a placeholder, see later)
                        </li><li>
                          If the person also sings while they play - they can treat that part as another turn/person - either immediately after their instrument turn or later (might be more fun to hear other parts before putting their voice on.</li><li>
Put your part on a track - and put that “stem” in a shared folder.
                        </li><li>
Then let the next person know it’s their turn. - They pull down the current stems and add their part to the recording.
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h3>Parallel Processing (PP)</h3>
                      <p>
Similar process as above - but instead of starting with one person and then going to the next. Everyone starts at the same time - using only the Lead Sheet and a predetermined tempo - write, play and record a part.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>For Both Methods:</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>
When all the parts are done - the arrangement is put together and listened to as a group and discussed  - 
<ul><li>Do any parts need to change?</li><li>  Do we want to add sections?  </li>
</ul>
                  </li><li>
If a new section is desired
<ol><li>A Lead Sheet Addendum is made to say what the chords (And melody if not improvised) are to be in the new section(s)</li><li>It's submitted to PP.</li></ol>
                  </li><li>
                    If no new sections are needed and just parts just need updating<ul><li>repeat the process with either RR or PP until Musical Director (MD) says it's good enough to be used for rehearsal.</li></ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
